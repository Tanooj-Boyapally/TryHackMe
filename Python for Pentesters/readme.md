in this room i learn about python scripts for pentesting
- using python to enumerate the targets subdomain
- python script to build a simple keylogger
- python script to build network scanner to find target systems
- script for scanning the targets for open ports
- script for downloading files from internet
- script to cracking hashes

  **important libraries for pentesting**
  - **requests** [ used for making HTTP and HTTPS requests ]
  - **sys**   [ The sys module in Python provides various functions and variables that are used to manipulate different parts of the Python runtime environment]
  - **scapy** [ used for working with network packets ]
  - **socket** [ socket is a way to talk to other computers ]
  - **hashlib** [ hash function on a string and encrypt it so that it is very difficult to decrypt it ]
  - **pyfiglet** [ to enhance our programming experience as well as to enhance the overall look and structure of the texts used in electronic communication. ]
  -  **keyboard** [ which is used to get full control of the keyboard. ]
 
  **installing libraries for python using terminal**
  - apt install python3-scapy
  - pip3 install scapy
    {both are used to install packages} not [alternatively one or the other]
