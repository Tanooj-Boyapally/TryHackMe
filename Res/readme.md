this room was not so good and i dont like it cause first half of the answers can be solved just by nmap scan 
then after while doing privilege escalation commands are not working and cant go forward thats why i just viewed the writeup of some others and solved some part 
one thing can be noticed here in this room is 
- $ redis-cli
  it is a command used to get shell, when redis is the database used by the server
